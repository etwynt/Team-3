# Average line
plt.axvline(pokemon_df['Total'].mean(), linestyle='dashed', color='yellow')

# Min line
plt.axvline(pokemon_df['Total'].min(), linestyle='dashed', color='green')

# Max line
plt.axvline(pokemon_df['Total'].max(), linestyle='dashed', color='hotpink')

# Adding grid
plt.grid(axis='x', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)



# Creating histogram with 3 bins

value = plt.hist(pokemon_df['Total'], bins = 3, color='dodgerblue', edgecolor='black', alpha=0.7)

hist_values = value[0]
bin_edges = value[1]

print('Histogram counts:', hist_values)
print('Bin edges', bin_edges)  # the end value is not included


# value_counts - How to calculate the same histogram with value counts?

pokemon_df['Total'].value_counts(bins=[179, 379, 579, 781])

# calculating from the last bin

# Another way of creating a histogram from column Legendary

## TEAMWORK

To complete the tasks use 'pokemon.csv' dataset
Answer the following questions:
How many Pokémons are with 'Type 1' == Water as a % of total?
What is the maximum 'Speed' value? What is the minimum 'Speed' value? What is the difference between max and min 'Speed'?
Filter the DataFrame to include only the Pokémon with 'Speed' >= 80. How many Pokémon meet this criterion? Display this DataFrame using your preferred visualization method.
(DIFFICULT) Find Pokémon with the longest name (excluding spaces)? What is this pokemons name?


```py

type1_water = pokemon_df[pokemon_df['Type 1'] == 'Water']
type1_water_percentage = (len(type1_water)) / (len(pokemon_df.index)) * 100
type1_water_percentage
```

```py
max_speed = pokemon_df['Speed'].max()

min_speed = pokemon_df['Speed'].min()

speed_difference = max_speed - min_speed

print("Max Speed:", max_speed)
print("Min Speed:", min_speed)
print("Speed Difference:", speed_difference)
```

```py
#Filter the DataFrame to include only the Pokémon with 'Speed' >= 80.
# How many Pokémon meet this criterion? Display this DataFrame using your preferred visualization method.

speed_80 = pokemon_df[pokemon_df['Speed'] >= 80]
print(len(speed_80))


plt.hist(pokemon_df['Speed'], color="purple", edgecolor="black", alpha = 0.9)

plt.xlabel("Speed")
plt.ylabel("Number of pokemons")

# average line, access a vertical line
plt.axvline(pokemon_df['Speed'].mean(), linestyle="dashed", color='yellow')

#add min line
plt.axvline(pokemon_df['Speed'].min(), linestyle='dashdot', color='red')

#add max line
plt.axvline(pokemon_df['Speed'].max(), linestyle='dashdot', color='blue')


plt.grid(linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
```
