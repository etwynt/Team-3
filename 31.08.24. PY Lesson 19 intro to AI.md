## Intro to GPT

** Intro to GenAI, models, people
** RGB example, creating colors

A Pixel is the combination of RGB colors together. Every pixel has these 3 colors. From 0-255 (0 is dark, 255 is the brightest state). 

Encoding the color values:

** Tokens and embedding vectors

- In simple terms, tokens are words or pieces of words that the AI uses to understand and generate text. 
- Embedding vectors are numerical representations of words or tokens that capture their meanings and relationships. 
In simple terms, they are like lists of numbers that help the AI understand the context and meaning of words by placing similar words closer together in a multi-dimensional space. 
This helps the AI recognize and work with language more effectively.
