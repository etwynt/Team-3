* When sending a Query (select, insert, update etc) you can have max 5 connections.
Whether the 6th query is dropped or queued depends on how your database connection pool is configured

![Screenshot 2024-08-28 at 18 43 46](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49b267af-5d7c-40ff-8f17-214001ea3fc6)

* Connection Limits: The limit of 5 connections refers to the maximum number of concurrent database connections that can be handled at a time.
This limit is often set by the database configuration or by the connection pool settings in your application.
It means that only 5 separate connections can be open at the same time.

```sql
CREATE TABLE persons

(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name varchar(20));


-- PRIMARY KEY = ID is unique
-- varchar = a string/just a text
-- AUTOINCREMENT = create new numbers/automatically increments the id number
```

* Oskars example for autoincrement with names:
  
1. Oskars
2. Anna
3. Laila
4. Andrey

Delete where id = 3

1. Oskars
2. Anna
4. Andrey

Add Laila

1. Oskars
2. Anna
4. Andrey
5. Laila

Delete where id = 5

1. Oskars
2. Anna
4. Andrey

Add Laila again

1. Oskars
2. Anna
4. Andrey
6. Laila


```sql
INSERT INTO persons (name) VALUES (
  'oskars'
  );
  
  SELECT * FROM persons
```
```sql
INSERT INTO persons (name) VALUES (
  'lelde'
  );
  
  SELECT * FROM persons
```

## TEAMWORK ##

1. Download dbBrowser for sqlite
https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/

2. Try to open the database that you created in your project (you can see the my.db in files on the left side)

3. Read about SQL, learn insert, delete, update, select on this page https://sqliteonline.com/. (A lot of resources is here https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp).

4. Create 3 tables with some non-complex data, populate them with values, you will be able to use this database later on, but this is just for you to practise and understand db a bit better.

In IntelliJ, we created a New Project (name for example "RepositoryExample") and downloaded a library:

(right click on project name --> Open Module Settings)

Select Global Libraries and From Maven...

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/138a91e7-c1de-4114-9925-7948665895da)

Make this selection and click OK and (Apply +) OK

In Main.java, 3 tables are created and values are insterted:
```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String url = "jdbc:sqlite:my.db";

        String createTable1 = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students ("
                + "id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,"
                + "name TEXT NOT NULL,"
                + "age INTEGER"
                + ");";

        String createTable2 = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS courses ("
                + "id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,"
                + "course_name TEXT NOT NULL,"
                + "instructor TEXT"
                + ");";

        String createTable3 = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS enrollment ("
                + "student_id INTEGER,"
                + "course_id INTEGER,"
                + "enrollment_date TEXT,"
                + "FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(id),"
                + "FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(id)"
                + ");";

        String insertIntoStudents = "INSERT INTO students (name, age) VALUES "
                + "('Elery', 28),"
                + "('Marina', 29),"
                + "('Lelde', 27),"
                + "('Britta', 26),"
                + "('Ellen', 29);";

        String insertIntoCourses = "INSERT INTO courses (course_name, instructor) VALUES "
                + "('Python', 'Dr. Roberta'),"
                + "('Java', 'Dr. Oskars'),"
                + "('AI', 'Dr. Elchin');";

        String insertIntoEnrollment = "INSERT INTO enrollment (student_id, course_id, enrollment_date) VALUES "
                + "(1, 1, '20-03-2024'),"
                + "(2, 2, '27-03-2024'),"
                + "(3, 3, '31-08-2024');";

        try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url);
             Statement statement = connection.createStatement()) {

            statement.execute(createTable1);
            statement.execute(createTable2);
            statement.execute(createTable3);

            statement.execute(insertIntoStudents);
            statement.execute(insertIntoCourses);
            statement.execute(insertIntoEnrollment);

            System.out.println("Tables created and data inserted successfully.");

        } catch (SQLException e) {
            System.err.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

After running the code, result is 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/240b1a83-9f4d-45e1-b347-c9eee260aa18)

and "my.db" is created. To open this database directly in IntelliJ

1. Open the Database Tool Window: Go to View > Tool Windows > Database.
2. Add Data Source:
    * Click the + button to add a new data source.
    * Select SQLite.
    * In the "File" field, browse to your my.db file.
3. View Tables: You can now explore the structure and data in your database directly within IntelliJ.
