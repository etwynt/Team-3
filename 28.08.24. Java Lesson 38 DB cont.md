* When sending a Query (select, insert, update etc) you can have max 5 connections.
Whether the 6th query is dropped or queued depends on how your database connection pool is configured

* Connection Limits: The limit of 5 connections refers to the maximum number of concurrent database connections that can be handled at a time.
This limit is often set by the database configuration or by the connection pool settings in your application.
It means that only 5 separate connections can be open at the same time.

```sql
CREATE TABLE persons

(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name varchar(20));


-- PRIMARY KEY = ID is unique
-- varchar = a string/just a text
-- AUTOINCREMENT = create new numbers/automatically increments the id number
```

* Oskars example for autoincrement with names:
  
1. Oskars
2. Anna
3. Laila
4. Andrey

Delete where id = 3

1. Oskars
2. Anna
4. Andrey

Add Laila

1. Oskars
2. Anna
4. Andrey
5. Laila

Delete where id = 5

1. Oskars
2. Anna
4. Andrey

Add Laila again

1. Oskars
2. Anna
4. Andrey
6. Laila


```sql
INSERT INTO persons (name) VALUES (
  'oskars'
  );
  
  SELECT * FROM persons
```
```sql
INSERT INTO persons (name) VALUES (
  'lelde'
  );
  
  SELECT * FROM persons
```
