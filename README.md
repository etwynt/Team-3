We have a dynamic and diverse group of five women, each bringing unique experiences and aspirations to the table.

Among us, there is a spirited Latvian who balances her time between her two cats, her husband, and her love for books and the outdoors. Another member, an Estonian, is a devoted mother to a one-year-old boy and a cat owner. With a background in hotel management, she seeks a more flexible and financially rewarding career. 

The group also includes an Estonian woman who cherishes her family life, which includes her husband, their beloved cat and dog, and their two-year-old son. She, too, is on a journey to find a meaningful and satisfying path forward. Another member, also Estonian, recently completed her bachelor's degree, realized her true passion lies elsewhere. Inspired by this program and a colleague, she is now pursuing new opportunities.

Our fifth member remains a bit of a mystery but is very happy to be part of this powerful group of women.

Together, we are excited to embark on this journey of learning, growth, and transformation, united by our shared goals and individual strengths.
