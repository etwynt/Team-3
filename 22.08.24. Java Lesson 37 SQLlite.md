* A unique key in SQL ensures that all values in a specific column or a set of columns are unique across the table.
This means no two rows can have the same value in that column or set of columns.

* A foreign key establishes a link between two tables by ensuring that a column (or a set of columns) in one table matches a column (usually the primary key) in another table.
This helps maintain referential integrity between tables.

* Different types of SQL JOINS:

- (INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables;
- LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table;
- RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table;
- FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table;
- LEFT ANTI JOIN: Returns rows in the left table that have no matching rows in the right table; 
- RIGHT ANTI JOIN: Returns rows in the right table that have no matching rows in the left table.
