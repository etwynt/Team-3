## NumPy:

* NumPy is a Python library used for numerical computations. 
It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. 
It's especially useful for tasks involving heavy calculations or data manipulation, like those in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing

* The sys.getsizeof() function in Python returns the size of an object in bytes, representing the memory used by that object.

* Diffrenece between Py lists and arrays:

```py
import numpy as np
```

```py
coin = ["Heads", "Tails"] #variable we'll need to use/ one dimensional array == list/ this is parameter a

coin
```

```py
number_of_throws = 1000 #variable we'll need to use/ size
```
