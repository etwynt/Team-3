### Using POST vs DELETE:

* POST: This is used when you want to create or change something. 
It's not idempotent, meaning if you send the same request multiple times, it can create or change something different each time. 
For example, if you submit a form twice, it might create two new entries.

* DELETE: This is used to remove something. 
It's usually idempotent, meaning if you send the same request multiple times, the result will be the same: 
the resource will be deleted, or if it's already gone, nothing will happen.

There is little difference in the technical part between these two. 

### SOFT delete vs HARD delete:

* Soft Delete: When you "soft delete" something, it looks like it's gone, but it's still kept in the system. 
The item is usually marked as deleted, but you can recover it later if needed. Think of it like moving a file to the Recycle Bin on your computer—it’s not permanently gone yet.

* Hard Delete: When you "hard delete" something, it’s completely removed from the system. 
You can’t recover it later. This is like permanently deleting a file—it’s gone for good.


* RequestBody == whole object, RequestParam == one parameter from the object

## HIBERNATE ORM

Hibernate ORM is a powerful framework in Java that simplifies the interaction between Java applications and relational databases. It uses a technique called Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to bridge the gap between object-oriented programming and relational database structures.

:zap: What is Hibernate ORM?

Hibernate allows developers to map Java objects to database tables, enabling them to work with data in a more intuitive way. Instead of writing complex SQL queries, developers can manipulate Java objects directly, and Hibernate handles the conversion of these objects into SQL statements behind the scenes. This greatly reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed for database operations.

:zap: Key Features of Hibernate

Object-Relational Mapping: Hibernate maps Java classes to database tables and Java data types to SQL data types. This mapping can be configured using XML files or Java annotations.

High-Level API: It provides a high-level API for performing common database operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records (CRUD operations).

Query Language: Hibernate includes Hibernate Query Language (HQL), which is similar to SQL but operates on Java objects instead of database tables. This allows for database-independent queries, making it easier to switch databases without rewriting queries.

Lazy Loading: This feature allows Hibernate to load data only when it is actually needed, improving performance by reducing the amount of data fetched from the database at once.

Caching: Hibernate supports caching mechanisms to enhance performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the need for repeated database queries.

Transaction Management: It provides built-in support for managing transactions, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

:zap: Advantages of Using Hibernate

Reduced Development Time: By eliminating the need for extensive SQL coding, Hibernate allows developers to focus more on business logic rather than database interactions.

Database Independence: Hibernate abstracts the database layer, allowing developers to switch databases with minimal changes to the code.
Support for Complex Relationships: It can handle complex relationships between objects, such as one-to-many and many-to-many associations, making it easier to model real-world scenarios.

Open Source: Hibernate is open-source software, which means it is free to use and has a large community for support and contributions.


* In summary, Hibernate ORM is a robust framework that simplifies the handling of data persistence in Java applications, making it easier for developers to manage database interactions without getting bogged down in SQL syntax and complexities. Its features like lazy loading, caching, and transaction management contribute to building efficient and scalable applications.
