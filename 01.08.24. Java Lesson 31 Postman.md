Postman = like a hard version of a browser.

Postman is a tool used to test and interact with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).
Imagine you're building a web or mobile app, and you need to communicate with a server to get or send data—like fetching a list of users or submitting a form. The server provides an API for this. Postman helps you easily send requests to this API and see the responses.

Here’s a simple breakdown:

Sending Requests: 
You can use Postman to send different types of HTTP requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to an API. For example, if an API has an endpoint, you can use Postman to send a GET request to retrieve user data.

Viewing Responses: 
After sending a request, Postman shows you the server’s response, which usually includes data in formats like JSON or XML. You can see the data, status codes, and headers the server returns.

Testing APIs: 
Postman also lets you automate testing of APIs. You can set up scripts to run tests on your requests, ensuring that your API behaves as expected.

Collaborating: 
If you’re working in a team, Postman allows you to share your API requests and collections (groups of requests) with others.

In short, Postman is like a browser specifically designed for interacting with APIs. It makes it easy to send requests, see responses, and debug or test APIs without writing code.

## Methods 

1. GET
Purpose: Retrieve data from a server.
Example: If you send a GET request, you're asking the server to return a list of users.
Analogy: Like reading a page from a book; you’re just looking at it without changing anything.
2. POST
Purpose: Send data to a server to create a new resource.
Example: Sending a POST request with user data in the body might create a new user.
Analogy: Like filling out a form and submitting it to create a new account; you’re adding something new.
3. PUT
Purpose: Update an existing resource completely or create it if it doesn't exist.
Example: Sending a PUT request with new data might update the user with ID 1.
Analogy: Like replacing an entire page in a book with a new version; the whole content changes.
4. PATCH
Purpose: Update part of an existing resource.
Example: Sending a PATCH request with only a new email address might update just that email for the user with ID 1.
Analogy: Like editing just a few lines of a page in a book without changing the rest; a partial update.
5. DELETE
Purpose: Remove a resource from the server.
Example: Sending a DELETE request would delete the user with ID 1.
Analogy: Like tearing out a page from a book; you’re removing something.
6. HEAD
Purpose: Retrieve the headers of a resource, without the actual data (like a GET request but without the body).
Example: A HEAD request might return metadata about the users, like content type and length, without the actual user data.
Analogy: Like checking the table of contents of a book without actually reading the pages.
7. OPTIONS
Purpose: Ask the server what HTTP methods are allowed or supported for a specific URL.
Example: Sending an OPTIONS request might return information that this endpoint supports GET, POST, and DELETE methods.
Analogy: Like asking the librarian what you can do with a book before you touch it.
