## DATABASE :
A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. 
A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). 
Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.

* Why are there many kinds of SQL DB?: 

Many SQL databases are because different databases are optimized for different use cases, architectures, and workloads etc.
When the first SQL standard was approved, there were already several implementations of SQL. 
Those then had to change to conform. Meanwhile, they were also changing to solve new problems or problems unaddressed in the standard.

The key difference between SQL databases and MongoDB lies in their underlying data models, which dictate how data is stored, managed, and retrieved.

Not a good practice to use spaces in the columns.
