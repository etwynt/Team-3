## DATABASE :
A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. 
A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). 
Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.

* Why are there many kinds of SQL DB?: 

Many SQL databases are because different databases are optimized for different use cases, architectures, and workloads etc.
When the first SQL standard was approved, there were already several implementations of SQL. 
Those then had to change to conform. Meanwhile, they were also changing to solve new problems or problems unaddressed in the standard.

The key difference between SQL databases and MongoDB lies in their underlying data models, which dictate how data is stored, managed, and retrieved.

'*' means all columns
Not a good practice to use spaces in the columns.

## TEAMWORK 
* Explore different filters and their combinations with SQL
* Use our Pet clinics files
* Use online free SQLight platform https://sqliteonline.com/

**Example 1**

We are filtering 
* pets that are cats or dogs
* female pets older than 5 years
* pets that have a name starting with the letter 'E' and including the letter 'y'
* result column names to 'PetID', 'Name', 'Kind' and 'Age'

```sql
SELECT PetID, Name, Kind, Age
FROM Pets 
WHERE Kind IN ('Cat', 'Dog') 
  AND Sex = 'female' 
  AND Age > 5 
  AND (Name LIKE 'E%' AND Name LIKE '%y%')
```

Result:
