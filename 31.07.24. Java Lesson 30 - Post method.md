Get method is used to receive data. It's only sending parameters through the url.
## POST method:

The POST method is a way for a web browser (or any client) to send data to a server to create or update a resource. It’s one of the HTTP methods used in web development, similar to GET, but with a different purpose.

Simple Explanation:
GET: When you want to get or retrieve data from the server (like when you open a webpage).
POST: When you want to send data to the server (like when you submit a form with your name and email).
Real-World Example:
Imagine you’re filling out a sign-up form on a website. You enter your name, email, and password, then click “Submit.” What happens next is:

The browser collects the information you entered.
It sends that information to the server using the POST method.
The server receives the data and might create a new account for you or process your information in some way.
Technical Details:
Data is sent in the body of the HTTP request, not in the URL like with GET.
POST is often used for actions that change data on the server (like adding a new user or posting a comment).
Because POST can send larger amounts of data and supports more complex data structures, it’s commonly used for form submissions, file uploads, and API requests.
In short, POST is the method used when you want to send data to a server to be processed or stored.
