## What is REGEX?

Regex (regular expression) is a tool used to search, match, or manipulate text based on specific patterns. 
Think of it like a smart filter that helps you find particular sequences of characters, such as emails, phone numbers, or words.

For example, r"\d+" is a regex pattern that matches any sequence of digits (e.g., "123" or "4567"). You can use the re module in Python to work with regex.
