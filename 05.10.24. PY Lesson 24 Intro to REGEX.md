## What is REGEX?

Regex (regular expression) is a tool used to search, match, or manipulate text based on specific patterns. 
Think of it like a smart filter that helps you find particular sequences of characters, such as emails, phone numbers, or words.

For example, r"\d+" is a regex pattern that matches any sequence of digits (e.g., "123" or "4567"). You can use the re module in Python to work with regex.

âœ¨ In your pattern: r'\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}' (figuring out a pattern for a phone number)

r = raw data

\d{3}: Matches exactly three digits

-: Matches a literal hyphen (-)

\d{3}-\d{4}: Matches another three digits, a hyphen, and four digits


## Code from Google Collab

```py
import re # re being the module used for regular expressions
```

```py
text = """
Alice: 555-123-4567
Bob: 333-987-6543
Charlie: 777-555-88
"""

#tripple quotes means you can split the text string into multiple lines

text
```

```py
pattern = r'\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}' # figure out the pattern

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(matches)

# required output: 555-123-4567, 333-987-6543

# r = rw string
# d = digit/number
```

```py
# re.search - first occurance of a pattern
# re.findall - finds all the occurances
# re.IGNORECASE - pattern matching is case-sensitive
```

### DATES pattern matching 

```py
dates = """
My dates are: 05-10-2024 and 2022-10-05
"""

pattern2 = r'\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{4}'

matches2 = re.findall(pattern2, dates)

print(matches2)
```

### E-MAIL ADRESS matching

```py
emails = """
Emails: liza@example.com, roberta.murn@gmail.com, info@company.net
"""

pattern3 = pattern3 = r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b'
# /b is a word boundary that matches the position where a word starts or ends. It ensures that the match is isolated and not part of a larger string of characters.

matches3 = re.findall(pattern3, emails)
print(matches3)

# requested output ['liz@example.com', 'roberta.murn@gmail.com', 'info@company.net']
```
