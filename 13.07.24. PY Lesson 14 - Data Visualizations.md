# TEAMWORK #
Start with Task 1 and proceed further as complexity will increase: To complete the tasks use 'transaction_dataset.csv' 
### Task 1: ###
Create a bar chart that shows the count of customers for each unique value in the 'Gender' column (including NaN values). - easy 

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Reading the file
dataset = pd.read_csv('/content/transaction_dataset.csv')

# Processing the data
gender_counts = dataset['Gender'].fillna('Unknown').value_counts().reset_index()
gender_counts.columns = ['Gender', 'Count']

# Plot the bar chart
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(gender_counts['Gender'], gender_counts['Count'], color='skyblue')
plt.title('Count of Customers by Gender')
plt.xlabel('Gender')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
```

### Task 2: ###
Create a horizontal bar chart that shows the top 5 most frequent names in the DataFrame, based on the 'name' column. (
First, create a grouped DataFrame (name_df), then filter it using iloc, and finally create the visualization.) -medium 

```python
dataset['Name'].value_counts()
name_df = dataset['Name'].value_counts().reset_index()
name_df.columns = ['Name', 'count']

# Select the top 5 most frequent names
top5_names = name_df.iloc[:5]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.barh(top5_names['Name'], top5_names['count'], color='orange')
plt.title('Top 5 Most Frequent Names')
plt.xlabel('count')
plt.ylabel('Name')
plt.gca().invert_yaxis()  # Invert y-axis to have the highest count at the top
plt.show()
```

### Task 3: ###
Create a filtered DataFrame that includes Category == 'Clothing' and Gender == 'M'. How many rows are there in this filtered DataFrame? 
Format the result as follows: The filtered DataFrame has XXXX rows. - hard

```python
filtered_df = dataset[(dataset['Category'] == 'Clothing') & (dataset['Gender'] == 'M')]

num_rows = len(filtered_df)[Uploading L14_Data_visualizations.ipynbâ€¦]()


print(f'This filtered DataFrame has {num_rows} rows.')
```

# Lesson 14 Data Visualisations # 

For data visualisation we use MATPLOTLIB

#EXAMPLE FROM SYNTHETIC DATA

```py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

from matplotlib.patches import PathPatch
from matplotlib.path import Path
```


# Sample data representing the average temperature (in degrees Celsius) from 2010 to 2014

```py
data = {'Year': [2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014],
        'Avg_Temperature': [14.1, 14.3, 14.5, 14.2, 14.6]} # This is a data object

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df
```

# VERSION ONE of ways to plot data - using this when wanting to use specific customization for the plot, slightly more complicated

plt.plot(df['Year'], df['Avg_Temperature'], marker='o') #square brackets refer to a column; first value is X, second is Y

plt.title('Average temperature from 2010 to 2014') #here we added title

plt.xlabel('Year') #added title for X axis
plt.ylabel('Temperature') #title for Y axis

plt.xticks(df['Year']) #year values are rounded

plt.grid(True) #adding grid

plt.show() #shows you the visualization

# VERSION TWO of ways to plot data - high level plotting function provided by Pandas plotting library

df.plot(x='Year', y='Avg_Temperature', kind='line') #use this for very quick, simple visualization

plt.title('Average temperature from 2010 to 2014') #here we added title

plt.xlabel('Year') #added title for X axis
plt.ylabel('Temperature') #title for Y axis

plt.xticks(df['Year']) #year values are rounded

plt.grid(True) #adding grid

plt.show() #shows you the visualization

The difference between df.plot() and plt.plot() lies in the library-specific functions used and the level of control and customization each offers. Here are the details:

df.plot()
This is a high-level plotting function provided by the pandas library, which acts as a wrapper around matplotlib. It simplifies the process of creating a plot directly from a pandas DataFrame. (When we say that df.plot() in pandas is a "wrapper around matplotlib," it means that the pandas plotting functions are built on top of matplotlib.)

Pros:

Simplicity: Easy to use, especially for quick plots directly from a DataFrame.
Integration: Works directly with DataFrame columns, making it very convenient for exploratory data analysis.
Less Code: Requires less code to generate a plot.
Cons:

Less Customization: While it's great for quick plots, it offers less fine-grained control over the plot appearance compared to matplotlib.
plt.plot()
This is a low-level plotting function from the matplotlib library. It requires more code but offers extensive customization options for creating detailed and complex plots.

Pros:

Customization: Allows for extensive customization of all aspects of the plot (titles, labels, colors, markers, grid, etc.).
Flexibility: Suitable for creating complex and highly customized plots.
Control: Provides more control over the plotting process and appearance.
Cons:

Complexity: Requires more lines of code and a deeper understanding of matplotlib.
Summary

df.plot() is convenient for quick, simple plots directly from a DataFrame with minimal code.
plt.plot() offers more detailed and customizable plotting options but requires more code and understanding of the matplotlib library.
Both methods are useful depending on the context: use df.plot() for quick visualization and plt.plot() for more detailed and customized plots. Code Abstraction By abstracting the complexity of matplotlib, pandas plotting functions make it easier to create standard plots quickly. For users who need basic visualizations, this means they can focus on their data rather than learning the intricacies of matplotlib. Customization with Matplotlib While pandas provides a simplified interface, the plots created are still matplotlib objects. This means you can further customize these plots using matplotlib functions if needed.

# BAR CHART

plt.bar(df['Year'], df['Avg_Temperature'], color='lavender') #color can be selected by you

plt.title('Average temperature from 2010 to 2014')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Temperature')

# H-BAR CHART (a horizontal bar chart)

plt.barh(df['Year'], df['Avg_Temperature'], color='thistle') #color can be selected by you

plt.title('Average temperature from 2010 to 2014')
plt.xlabel('Temperature')
plt.ylabel('Year')

# HISTOGRAM - represents the distribution of a single variable, frequency, numerical data or how often a variable appears :
# a histogram helps you see the distribution of something by showing you how many items fall into each group.

data2 = {'Scores': [85, 92, 78, 20, 89, 90, 82, 56, 60, 23, 91, 40, 77]}
df2 = pd.DataFrame(data2)
df2

plt.hist(df2['Scores'], bins=5, color='green', edgecolor='black') #bins - in how many groups the data will be grouped


#custom bin edges
bin_edges = [0, 40, 60, 80, 90, 100]
plt.hist(df2['Scores'], bins=bin_edges, color = 'green', edgecolor = 'black')

# SCATTER PLOT - used to visualize the relationship between two variables

data3 = {'X': [1,2,3,5,5,2], 'Y':[5,8,7,4,9,5]}

df3 = pd.DataFrame(data3)

plt.scatter(x = df3['X'], y=df3['Y'])
plt.title('Scatter Plot')
plt.grid(True)

# PIE CHART - it represents parts of a whole

data4 = {'Category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'], 'Values': [15, 30, 25, 40]}
df4 = pd.DataFrame(data4)
df4

plt.pie(df4['Values'], labels = df4['Category'], autopct='%1.1f%%') #pct means automatic percentage
plt.title('Pie Chart')
plt.show()

# BOX PLOT - presents distribution of a dataset and identifies outliers (it's like a normal distribution plot viewed from above)

df4

plt.boxplot(df4['Values'])
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()  #25% quartiles - 50% within the box

VALUE COUNTS method counts how many times a value repeats. Work on series - that's why we need to define a column.

dataset = pd.read_csv('/content/transaction_dataset.csv') # reading the file

dataset.head() # looking at first 5 values (by default)

dataset.info()

# Value Counts method counts how many times a value repeats

dataset['Category'].value_counts()



dataset['Gender'].value_counts(dropna=False).reset_index() #to alse see NaN (not a number) values
