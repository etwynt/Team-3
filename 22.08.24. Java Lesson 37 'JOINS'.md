## Working with 'JOIN' ##

<img width="896" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-22 at 18 30 09" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3334c0a-4723-4d5c-876f-0f539b731de7">


* A unique key in SQL ensures that all values in a specific column or a set of columns are unique across the table.
This means no two rows can have the same value in that column or set of columns.

* A foreign key establishes a link between two tables by ensuring that a column (or a set of columns) in one table matches a column (usually the primary key) in another table.
This helps maintain referential integrity between tables.

* Different types of SQL JOINS:

- (INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables (only the foreign keys that match in both tables are selected);
- LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table;
- RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table;
- FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table;
- LEFT ANTI JOIN: Returns rows in the left table that have no matching rows in the right table (selects foreign keys that are not common between the tables); 
- RIGHT ANTI JOIN: Returns rows in the right table that have no matching rows in the left table (selects foreign keys that are not common between the tables).

```

Calculate the amount of sales by Procedure Type
```sql
select Sales.ProcedureCode, SUM(Procedures.Price) as TotalSales
from Sales left join Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode
group by Sales.ProcedureCode
order by TotalSales DESC;
```
OR a different way
```sql
select Sales.ProcedureCode, SUM(Procedures.Price) as TotalSales
from Sales left join Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode
group by Procedures.ProcedureType
order by TotalSales DESC;
```

## What are RELATIONSHIPS in SQLlite? ##

Relationships refer to the associations between tables based on common columns. 
These relationships allow you to connect data across different tables, enabling complex queries and ensuring data integrity. 
There are different types of relationships in SQLlite.

Types of Relationships: 

1. One-to-One (1:1) Relationship

- Definition: A relationship where a row in one table is associated with exactly one row in another table, and vice versa.
- Example: A Person table and a Passport table, where each person has exactly one passport, and each passport is linked to one person.
- Implementation: Use a foreign key in one table that references the primary key of the other table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Person (
    PersonID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    Name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE Passport (
    PassportID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    PersonID INTEGER,
    IssueDate DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Person(PersonID)
);
```

2. One-to-Many (1
) Relationship

- Definition: A relationship where a row in one table (the parent) can be associated with multiple rows in another table (the child), but each child row is associated with only one parent row.
- Example: A Customer table and an Orders table, where each customer can place multiple orders, but each order is associated with only one customer.
- Implementation: Use a foreign key in the child table that references the primary key in the parent table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customer (
    CustomerID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    Name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    OrderDate DATE,
    CustomerID INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customer(CustomerID)
);
```

3. Many-to-Many (N
) Relationship

- Definition: A relationship where rows in one table can be associated with multiple rows in another table, and vice versa.
- Example: A Students table and a Courses table, where each student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.
- Implementation: Create a junction table (also known as a linking or associative table) that holds foreign keys referencing the primary keys of both tables involved in the relationship.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    Name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE Courses (
    CourseID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    CourseName TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
    StudentID INTEGER,
    CourseID INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (StudentID, CourseID),
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID),
    FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Courses(CourseID)
);
```
In this example, Enrollments is the junction table that manages the many-to-many relationship between Students and Courses.

4. Enforcing Relationships with Foreign Keys
In SQLite, relationships are enforced using foreign keys. A foreign key in one table points to a primary key in another table, ensuring referential integrity by enforcing the following:

- Cascading Updates/Deletes: If a parent row is updated or deleted, the changes can cascade to the child rows.
- Referential Integrity: Ensures that a row in the child table cannot contain a foreign key value that doesn't exist in the parent table.
- Important: In SQLite, foreign key constraints are not enforced by default. You need to enable them using the following command:

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
```

Summary: 

* One-to-One: Each row in one table is linked to a single row in another table.
* One-to-Many: Each row in one table can be linked to multiple rows in another table.
* Many-to-Many: Multiple rows in one table can be linked to multiple rows in another table, managed through a junction table.
* Foreign Keys: Enforce relationships between tables, maintaining data integrity.
