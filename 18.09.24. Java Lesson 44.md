* What is a Unit Test?
  
A unit test is a specific code you want to write to make sure that a small protion of the porgram is working correctly.

* TDD (Test Driven Development)
  
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a programming approach where you write tests before writing the actual code. Here's how it works in simple terms:

1. Write a Test: You first create a small test for a specific part of the code, even though the code doesnâ€™t exist yet.
2. Write Code: You then write just enough code to make the test pass.
3. Refactor: After the test passes, you can clean up and improve the code without changing its behavior.
4. Repeat: You continue this process, creating new tests and then writing code to pass them.
   
The goal of TDD is to ensure your code works correctly and is easy to maintain.
