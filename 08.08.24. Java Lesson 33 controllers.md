## Packages

A package is like a folder on your computer that helps you organize your files. Just like you might put different types of documents in different folders to keep things tidy, in Java, you use packages to group related classes and interfaces together.

For example, if you're building a program with different features, you might have one package for the user interface code and another for the database code. This makes it easier to manage your code, avoid name conflicts, and find things quickly.
