## GIT

Main branch = main source of truth. 

:envelope: Git Pull: 

In Git, git pull is a command that updates your local repository with changes from a remote repository. 
It does this by fetching the latest changes from the remote (e.g., GitHub) and then merging those changes into your current branch. 
It's essentially a combination of two Git commands:

git fetch (which downloads new data from the remote)
git merge (which integrates the fetched changes into your current branch)

:envelope: Git Pull Origin Main: 

This command is more specific. It tells Git to pull the latest changes from the main branch of the remote repository named origin. Here's a breakdown:

origin: The default name for the remote repository (typically the one hosted on GitHub or another Git server).
main: The name of the branch you want to pull from (which is often the primary branch of the repository).
So, when you run git pull origin main, you're asking Git to fetch and merge the latest changes from the main branch of the remote origin into your current branch.


:envelope: Git Push:

Git Push is the command used in Git to upload (or "push") your local commits to a remote repository. 
Itâ€™s how you sync your changes from your local machine to the remote server, making the updates available to others.
