✨ What is an interface?

Think of an interface like a set of rules or a list of things that something should be able to do. 
It tells you what actions are possible but doesn’t say how to do them.

✨ Why use interfaces?

Interfaces help different parts of a program work together without knowing the details of how each part works. 

✨ What's the difference between Class and Interface?

Implementation: Classes provide implementation; interfaces do not. Classes can be instantiated, while interfaces cannot.

State: Classes can have state (data); interfaces cannot.

Purpose: Classes define how something works, while interfaces define what something can do.

✨ 
While interfaces and abstract classes can seem similar, they serve different purposes in object-oriented programming. 
An interface is not just an abstract class with an empty body; it defines a different kind of contract for implementing behaviors.

✨ Reminder - what is a businesss logic?

Business Logic = The rules and decisions that define how the program behaves to meet specific business needs.

Why is it important? - Because it tells the program what to do in different situations, just like a set of instructions for making your program handle real-world scenarios!
