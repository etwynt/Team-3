### Repository is like a DB gatekeeper, also improves efficiency and code.
* Laila's example : if the waiter is API, kitchen's chef is the Service (knows how to prep all the food), restaurant's food storage supervisor is like Repo
   (goes to check if all the ingredients are available) and DB is the food storage space at the restaurant.

### Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is like a protective wrapper around data in a class. It keeps the data safe by restricting direct access from outside the class and only allows controlled access 
through methods. This helps prevent unintended changes and keeps the data clean and secure.

* Each userController has their own userService and they are not impacting eachother, and each userService has their own userRepo. But all userRepo has access to the same DB.


## TEAMWORK 

1. Create UserController endpoint to get all users
2. Create a UserService method to get all users
3. Create a userRepository method to get all users
4. Add user with a postman
5. Try to get all the users with GET method
6. Repeat step 4 and 5
