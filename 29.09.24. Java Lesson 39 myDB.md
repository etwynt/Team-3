## Try/Catch

Using try/catch allows your program to handle errors gracefully without crashing. 
Instead of stopping, the program can take specific actions when an error happens, like showing an error message to the user or trying an alternative approach.

The try/catch concept in Java is used for handling exceptions, which are errors that can occur during the execution of a program.

Basic Idea:
* try block: You put the code that might cause an exception (error) inside this block. This is like saying, "Try to execute this code."
(Use it to wrap code that might cause an exception.)

* catch block: If an exception occurs in the try block, the program will jump to this block. It's like saying, "If something goes wrong, catch the problem here and handle it."
(Use it to define how to handle the exception if it occurs.)

* In Java, you can catch multiple different types of exceptions, but each catch block is designed to handle a specific type of exception. 
However, Java allows you to use multiple catch blocks after a single try block, so you can handle different types of exceptions differently.

### Code from the lesson 

```java
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.util.Scanner;


public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        //we ask the user for their name
        System.out.println("Please provide your name: ");
        var personsName = sc.nextLine();

        String url = "jdbc:sqlite:my.db";
        try (var conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url)) {
            if (conn != null) {
                var statement = conn.createStatement();
                statement.execute("INSERT INTO people (name) VALUES ('" + personsName +"')");
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            System.err.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
