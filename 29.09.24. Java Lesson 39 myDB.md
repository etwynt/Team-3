## Try/Catch

Using try/catch allows your program to handle errors gracefully without crashing. 
Instead of stopping, the program can take specific actions when an error happens, like showing an error message to the user or trying an alternative approach.

The try/catch concept in Java is used for handling exceptions, which are errors that can occur during the execution of a program.

Basic Idea:
* try block: You put the code that might cause an exception (error) inside this block. This is like saying, "Try to execute this code."
(Use it to wrap code that might cause an exception.)

* catch block: If an exception occurs in the try block, the program will jump to this block. It's like saying, "If something goes wrong, catch the problem here and handle it."
(Use it to define how to handle the exception if it occurs.)

* In Java, you can catch multiple different types of exceptions, but each catch block is designed to handle a specific type of exception. 
However, Java allows you to use multiple catch blocks after a single try block, so you can handle different types of exceptions differently.

### Code from the lesson 

```java
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.util.Scanner;


public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        //we ask the user for their name
        System.out.println("Please provide your name: ");
        var personsName = sc.nextLine();

        String url = "jdbc:sqlite:my.db";
        try (var conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url)) {
            if (conn != null) {
                var statement = conn.createStatement();
                statement.execute("INSERT INTO people (name) VALUES ('" + personsName +"')");
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            System.err.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### TEAMWORK ###

Use the example of SQL in Java and add an "AddUser" method inside the previous Datorium API project - UserRepository.
Try and run Postman and verify with DB Browser that the data is there. 

The previous project is with following source:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e8f9334-4078-4310-bfd9-c1d8f6bdde28)

The UserRepo.java is updated using code from todays lesson:
```java
package com.datorium.Datorium.API.Repo;

import com.datorium.Datorium.API.DTOs.UpdateUserDTO;
import com.datorium.Datorium.API.DTOs.User;

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class UserRepo {
    private ArrayList<User> users = new ArrayList<>();
    private static final String url = "jdbc:sqlite:my.db";

    public int add(User user) {
        try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url)) {
            if (conn != null) {
                Statement statement = conn.createStatement();
                statement.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS people (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name varchar(20))");
                statement.execute("INSERT INTO people (name) values ('" + user.name + "')");
            }
            return 1; // to show successful adding
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            System.err.println(e.getMessage());
        }
        return -1; // to show unsuccessful adding
    }

    public ArrayList<User> get() {
        return users;
    }

    public User update(int userIndex, User updateUserDTO) {
        User user = users.get(userIndex);
        user.name = updateUserDTO.name;
        return user;
    }
}
```

We also need to import required JDBC classes as we did yesterday:

Right click on project name --> Open Module Settings

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed979b16-d2fb-46c7-af8a-8b857ddcebef)

Select Global Libraries and From Maven...

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1ca8648-77db-42e7-9b5e-954fa2701472)

Make this selection and click OK

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf0fe1cc-d665-4983-b27c-82b0241d9463)

Choose Module Datorium-API.main and click OK

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba334253-54e2-40ca-8a3c-b3da546c5134)

Click OK again.
After running the code in IntelliJ, use POST in Postman and insert a name to database:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51dbb998-864d-4c44-9d15-4bdeb1025aff)

If the result is 1 then name was successfully added. If the result is -1, name adding failed. 

After successfully adding the name, open DB Browser (or view you DB directly from IntelliJ) and Open Database (choose the 'my' database from your computer, it is in the same folder as your project):

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4187af08-07aa-4d51-af5b-e73721234ce3)

After opening my.db in DB Browser, you can Browse Data and see that the name was added into 'people' table:
