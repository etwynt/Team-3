Continuing with the Pokemon project from previous lesson. 

```py
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

pokemon_df = pd.read_csv('/content/Pokemon.csv')

pokemon_df.head(n=5)

### Create a histogram of column 'Speed'

plt.hist(pokemon_df['Speed'], color = 'green', edgecolor = 'black') 
plt.xlabel('Total')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')

### Add min, max, mean (average) lines

# Average line
plt.axvline(pokemon_df['Total'].mean(), linestyle='dashed', color='yellow')

# Min line
plt.axvline(pokemon_df['Total'].min(), linestyle='dashed', color='green')

# Max line
plt.axvline(pokemon_df['Total'].max(), linestyle='dashed', color='hotpink')
```

# Correlation:
in Python correlation is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. 
If two variables are correlated, changes in one variable tend to be associated with changes in the other.

Positive Correlation: Both variables increase or decrease together.
Negative Correlation: As one variable increases, the other decreases.
No Correlation: The variables don't have any noticeable relationship.
In Python, you can calculate correlation using the corr() method in pandas or pearsonr() from the scipy.stats module.

Different types of correlation:

```py
## Scatter plot (punktu diagramma) between variables: Attack and Defenese /Scatter plots help us to see if there is any correlation

plt.scatter(pokemon_df['Attack'], pokemon_df['Defense'], color='navy', alpha=0.5)
plt.xlabel('Attack')
plt.ylabel('Defense')

# Create a scatter plot for variables: Speed and Defense

plt.scatter(pokemon_df['Speed'], pokemon_df['Defense'], color='darkorchid', alpha=0.5)
plt.xlabel('Speed')
plt.ylabel('Defense')

# Create a scatter plot for variables: HP and Defense

plt.scatter(pokemon_df['HP'], pokemon_df['Defense'], color='lightseagreen', alpha=0.5)
plt.xlabel('HP')
plt.ylabel('Defense')
```


# Pearson correlation:
Pearson correlation is a measure that quantifies the linear relationship between two variables. It tells you how strongly two variables are related and whether they increase or decrease together.

Value range: The Pearson correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1.
1 means a perfect positive correlation (as one variable increases, the other increases).
-1 means a perfect negative correlation (as one variable increases, the other decreases).
0 means no linear correlation.
It’s commonly used in statistics to see if there’s a linear relationship between two data sets.

* Weak Correlation: 0 to ±0.3
(The variables have a slight relationship, but it’s not strong.)

* Moderate Correlation: ±0.3 to ±0.7
(The variables have a noticeable relationship, but it’s not perfect.)

* Strong Correlation: ±0.7 to ±1
(The variables have a strong relationship, close to a linear pattern.)


```py
# Pearson correlation between Attack/Defense

correlation1 = pokemon_df['Attack'].corr(pokemon_df['Defense'])
correlation1 

#Result - these variables interact with each other but not very strongly

# Pearson correlation between Speed/Defense

correlation2 = pokemon_df['Speed'].corr(pokemon_df['Defense'])
correlation2

# Select only numeric columns

numeric_columns = pokemon_df.select_dtypes(include=['number'])
numeric_columns = numeric_columns.drop('#', axis=1)
numeric_columns

# for loop comparing target column and all other columns in the DataFrame

target_column = 'Attack'
correlation_results = {} #key = colum, value = pearson correlation

for col in numeric_columns.columns:
  if col =='Attack':
    continue
  correlation = pokemon_df[target_column].corr(pokemon_df[col])
  correlation_results[col] = correlation

correlation_results
```

# Correlation matrix:
A correlation matrix is a table that shows the correlation coefficients between multiple variables. Each cell in the matrix represents the correlation between two variables.

Diagonal values are always 1, because a variable is always perfectly correlated with itself.
Off-diagonal values indicate the correlation between different variables, with the same interpretation as individual correlation coefficients (ranging from -1 to 1).
It's a useful tool for quickly assessing the relationships between many variables at once.

```py
correlation_matrix = numeric_columns.corr() #all columns are numeric

correlation_matrix
```

# Visualising using seaborn library

https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.regplot.html

```py
import seaborn as sns

plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='viridis') # annotation = to add values
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
```

# Spurious correlations:

Spurious correlations refer to connections between two variables that appear to be related but are actually caused by something else or are just coincidental. In other words, the relationship is not real or meaningful.

For example, there might be a correlation between the number of ice cream sales and the number of shark attacks. However, this doesn't mean ice cream causes shark attacks. The real reason might be that both happen more in the summer, but they aren't directly related.

Spurious correlations often happen because of:

Coincidence: Two unrelated things happen to show similar patterns.
Confounding variables: A third factor influences both variables, making them seem related.
These correlations can be misleading, so it’s important to understand the context before drawing conclusions from data.

# Linear Regression - predicting one value based on the other

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model and analyze the relationship between two variables by fitting a straight line (called the regression line) to the data.

In simple terms:

Purpose: It helps you predict the value of one variable (the dependent variable) based on the value of another variable (the independent variable).

```py

sns.regplot(x = 'Attack', y = 'Defense', data=pokemon_df) #regplot - regression plot

sns.regplot(
    data=pokemon_df, x='Speed', y="Defense",
    ci=99, marker="x", color=".3", line_kws=dict(color="r"),
)

correlation2 = pokemon_df['Speed'].corr(pokemon_df['Defense'])
print('Pearson correlation coefficient:', correlation2)

#ci=99 - The confidence interval represents the range within which the true regression line is expected to fall, 
#with a specified level of confidence. The value ci=99 means that the plot will display a 99% confidence interval for the regression line.
# when chaning the ci=99 to, for example, ci=50, the shadow of the line changes.

sns.regplot(x='Speed', y='Defense', data=pokemon_df, color='purple', ci=99, marker='x', line_kws={'color':'red'})
plt.title('Speed vs Defense')
```

# TEAMWORK

Visualizing the correlation of Attack and Defense variables of two Types: Grass and Water Type 1 Pokémon.

1. Create two DataFrame Grass and Water

```py
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('/content/Pokemon.csv')

grass_df = df[df['Type 1'] == 'Grass']
water_df = df[df['Type 1'] == 'Water']
```
  
2. Create the regression plots for each (Grass and Water)

```py
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

# Grass Type Pokémon
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)  # (rows, columns, panel number)
sns.regplot(x='Attack', y='Defense', data=grass_df, color='indigo')
plt.title('Grass Type Pokémon')
plt.xlabel('Attack')
plt.ylabel('Defense')

# Water Type Pokémon
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
sns.regplot(x='Attack', y='Defense', data=water_df, color='maroon')
plt.title('Water Type Pokémon')
plt.xlabel('Attack')
plt.ylabel('Defense')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

3. Calculate the Pearson correlation for each DataFrame (variables: Attack and Defense)
   
```py
pearson_grass = grass_df['Attack'].corr(grass_df['Defense'])
pearson_water = water_df['Attack'].corr(water_df['Defense'])

print(f"Pearson Correlation for Grass Type Pokémon (Attack vs Defense): {pearson_grass}")
print(f"Pearson Correlation for Water Type Pokémon (Attack vs Defense): {pearson_water}")
```

4. Explain to each other what do you see and what it means.

Regression plots: 
Grass type - when you look at the regression plot you can see a scatter of data points with a line through it which represents the general trend between 'attack' and 'defense'. As the line goes upward, it means that 'attack' is increasing. But as the data point clusters are scattered, the relationship between 'attack' and 'defense' might be weaker or less predictable. 
Water type - similar as the grass type, the line goes in a positive direction, but the clusters of data points are more tightly packed, meaning the relationship between 'attack' and 'defense' is more strong.

We were surprised the Pearson correlation calculations are so similar (0.54 and 0.51) as with Water Type Pokemon the correlation seems stronger than with Grass Type Pokemon but is actually weaker. ChatGPT helped with explanation (there were more potential reasons but this seemed most relevant for these plots):
"The scales of the axes in both plots are different. The Water Type Pokémon plot has a wider range of attack values (from 20 to 160) compared to the Grass Type Pokémon plot (from 40 to 120). This difference in scale can make the correlation appear stronger in the Water Type Pokémon plot, even though the correlation value (Pearson) might be similar or lower."

Pearson correlation:
For both types it is apprx 0.5, and it means, that it is more the same, than different because it is clouser to 1 than to -1
