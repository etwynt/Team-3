# Correlation:
in Python correlation is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. 
If two variables are correlated, changes in one variable tend to be associated with changes in the other.

Positive Correlation: Both variables increase or decrease together.
Negative Correlation: As one variable increases, the other decreases.
No Correlation: The variables don't have any noticeable relationship.
In Python, you can calculate correlation using the corr() method in pandas or pearsonr() from the scipy.stats module.

Different types of correlation:

# Pearson correlation:
Pearson correlation is a measure that quantifies the linear relationship between two variables. It tells you how strongly two variables are related and whether they increase or decrease together.

Value range: The Pearson correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1.
1 means a perfect positive correlation (as one variable increases, the other increases).
-1 means a perfect negative correlation (as one variable increases, the other decreases).
0 means no linear correlation.
It’s commonly used in statistics to see if there’s a linear relationship between two data sets.

* Weak Correlation: 0 to ±0.3
(The variables have a slight relationship, but it’s not strong.)

* Moderate Correlation: ±0.3 to ±0.7
(The variables have a noticeable relationship, but it’s not perfect.)

* Strong Correlation: ±0.7 to ±1
(The variables have a strong relationship, close to a linear pattern.)
