Controller = API's
API checks rules and validations and gives a reply. 

What is a Controller?
A controller is a class that handles incoming HTTP requests and sends responses back to the client (e.g., a web browser or mobile app).
Controllers are responsible for mapping HTTP requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to specific methods that process these requests.
Controllers typically interact with services to perform business operations and then return data to the client, often in the form of JSON or HTML.
